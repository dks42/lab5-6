We chose the license becuase it allows for plenty of freedom. As stated, anyone may
"use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the
Software." For our very simple program, giving as many options to other programmers
will help bulid it into something more exciting

We chose the code of conduct because of the freedom given in the license. There must be
leaders in the project that will prevent any hatred or toxicity. It mostly outlines
how we expect members to act in the project.
